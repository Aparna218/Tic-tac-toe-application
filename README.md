Tic-Tac-Toe React Application

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O) on the board, and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If no player achieves three symbols in a row and the board is full, the game is considered a draw.

Features:
- Two-player mode: Play against your friend or family member locally.
- Dynamic status display: The application shows the current player's turn and announces the winner when the game is over.
- Simple and intuitive interface: Click on an empty cell to place your symbol on the board.
- Restart functionality: Start a new game with a click of a button after finishing the current game.

How to Play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Run the application using the 'npm start' or 'yarn start' command.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:3000' to start playing Tic-Tac-Toe!

This project was created as part of my journey to learn React and improve my front-end development skills. Feel free to provide feedback, or contribute to make the game even better!


Enjoy the game!
